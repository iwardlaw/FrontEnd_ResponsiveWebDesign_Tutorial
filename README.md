# Responsive Web Design Tutorial #

A sample web page to experiment with responsive design. Made by following along with [_Responsive Web Design_][aba-rwd] by Ethan Marcotte.

## General Philosophy ##

[Responsive web design][wiki-rwd] is the practice of making web pages that are viewable across different devices without losing information or inducing bad UX. It typically manifests as the dynamic rearrangement of a page's contents as its width grows and shrinks.

Marcotte describes how he synthesized the concept of responsive design and walks the reader through the process of converting a web page from desktop-static to responsive. He dedicates a chapter to each of responsive design's foundational elements&mdash;fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries&mdash;before stepping back and reframing everything from a mobile-first perspective.

## Discussion ##

### Flexible Images ###

### Media Queries ###

#### JavaScript Media Queries ####

## Next Steps ##

I intend to update this to use the more modern concept of CSS grids.
